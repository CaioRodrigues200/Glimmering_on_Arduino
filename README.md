# Glimpse on Arduino
 Some of my first codes on Arduino UNO, whether for testing or learning
 
## Favourite sources so far:

* [New Arduino Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGs0VKk2DiYw-L-RibttcvK-WBZm8WLEP) by [Paul McWhorter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfYfK0tzHZTpNFrc_NDKfTA)

## Simulation software in usage:

In this project, i mainly used [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) software as the circuit assembly tool and visual representation

## Arduino functionality and extra references:

For references about arduino architecture regarding its documentation: 
* [Introduction to the Arduino board](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/board)
* [PWM](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations/PWM)

In this project, [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) was utilized for the hardwork of compiling and uploading code to the board. Later on, an useful alternative was [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) VS Code extension, that can be usually a big helping hand in function of its great integration and feature selection. For compiling c++ files in general, i opted installing [GCC MinGW](https://youtu.be/aXF4A5UeSeM).
